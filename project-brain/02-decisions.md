# 02 — Decision Log

> Append-only. Newest entry at the TOP. Never edit old entries — if a decision is
> reversed, add a new entry linking back.
>
> **Scope of this file.** Architectural decisions live in `../DECISIONS.md` as numbered
> ADRs (ADR-001 … ADR-010, plus ten open questions Q1–Q10). That file is the authority and
> has its own supersede protocol — do **not** copy ADRs here or they will drift the first
> time one is superseded.
>
> This file is for **session-level decisions below the ADR bar**: tooling choices, local
> conventions, workflow calls, and "we tried X and chose Y" notes. If a decision
> constrains the data model, the masking boundary, or money handling, it belongs in
> `../DECISIONS.md` as a new ADR instead.
>
> Open spec questions follow the same split: genuinely open business questions go in the
> **Open questions** table in `../DECISIONS.md` with the safer default recorded, per
> working agreement 8 in `../CLAUDE.md`.

<!-- Format:

## YYYY-MM-DD — <short decision title>
- **Decision:** what was decided
- **Why:** the actual reason
- **Rejected:** alternatives considered and why they lost
- **Impact:** what this touches / constrains going forward
-->

## 2026-10-06 — Inline styles copied from the prototype via a parser helper

- **Decision:** port the prototype's markup keeping its inline `style="..."` strings
  verbatim, and convert them at render with a ~10-line `s()` helper that parses a CSS
  declaration string into a React style object.
- **Why:** the design handoff is high fidelity and declares every colour, size and spacing
  value final. Hand-converting ~15 screens of inline styles into style objects or CSS
  classes is where a one-day build dies, and every conversion is a chance to drift off the
  spec. Copying the strings keeps fidelity exact and makes porting mechanical.
- **Rejected:** (a) writing a template-to-JSX transpiler — the `{{ }}` / `sc-for` /
  `sc-if` format is simple but the edge cases around nested quotes and text nodes would eat
  more time than they save; (b) converting to Tailwind or CSS modules now — correct
  eventually, not today, and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` is agnostic about which.
- **Impact:** a runtime parse per styled element, which is negligible at this page size.
  Migrating to CSS modules later is a mechanical find-and-replace against the same strings.
  Recorded as a demo-time shortcut, not an endorsement.

## 2026-10-06 — Spec docs moved into docs/ rather than fixing CLAUDE.md's paths

- **Decision:** move the ten spec files from the repo root into `docs/`.
- **Why:** `CLAUDE.md` already referenced `docs/MASKING.md` and nine others in ten places,
  including the instruction to read `docs/MASKING.md` before touching any read path. Moving
  the files makes all ten references correct at once and leaves the contract untouched.
- **Rejected:** editing the ten references to point at the root — more edits, and it would
  have meant changing the project contract to match an accident rather than the reverse.
- **Impact:** `CLAUDE.md` is unchanged apart from the appended Project Brain section. The
  repo root is now the application root, which is what the Next.js scaffold wanted anyway.

## 2026-10-06 — Scope: all 15 screens, depth traded for breadth

- **Decision:** build all 15 screens from the design handoff for today's demo, implementing
  each screen's read path properly but little of the deeper business logic behind the later
  phases (assessments provider, brokering workflow, billing runs, duplicate detection).
- **Why:** the user has to demo the whole application today and chose breadth explicitly
  after being shown the trade-off. Masking stays fully enforced server-side regardless —
  it is cheap to do right now and a rewrite later, and it is the reason the product exists.
- **Rejected:** a six-screen hero-path slice with deeper logic. Better engineering, but it
  does not meet the stated need.
- **Impact:** screens behind the later phases render from seeded data with modest logic.
  What is *not* compromised: separate read models per portal, ADR-004 bands, bigint paise,
  random masked IDs, the snapshot shortlist. RLS is deferred — the read models are the
  first net, RLS is the second.

## 2026-10-06 — Project brain holds pointers, not copies

- **Decision:** `project-brain/` stays deliberately thin. `00-overview.md`,
  `01-architecture.md` and `02-decisions.md` link to the eleven root docs rather than
  summarising them. The files carrying genuinely new content are `01-architecture.md` →
  **Gotchas**, `03-progress.md`, `04-tasks.md` and the journal.
- **Why:** `../CLAUDE.md` states "do not duplicate content between them — link instead",
  and the root docs already own ~2,550 lines of spec. A brain that restates the ten ADRs
  becomes a second source of truth that silently diverges the first time an ADR is
  superseded — which is exactly the failure mode the ADR supersede protocol exists to
  prevent.
- **Rejected:** fully pre-filling every brain template from the docs. It reads better on
  day one and is wrong by month three.
- **Impact:** when a root doc changes, the brain usually needs no edit. Anything in the
  brain that *can* be derived from the docs should be deleted, not updated.
